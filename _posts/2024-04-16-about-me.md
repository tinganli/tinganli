I am a geomorphologist, specializing in fluvial and hillslope geomorphology. 
I am currently a postdoc fellow in the School of Environmental Science at Simon Fraser Univeristy. My current research projects are investigating: bedrock river channel erosion and controls on bedrock channel width; controls on grain size and its influence on landscape evolution; and river blockages by landslides. 
I will move to Caltech on Oct 2024 to work on aeolian sand transport and muddy rivers.
