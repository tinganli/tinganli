## What Controls Bedrock Channel Width?
Despite over 100 years of research on bedrock rivers, predicting channel width relies on empirical relations between water discharge and width or theory that makes bizarre assumptions about energy or roughness optimization with no physics basis. The question of how to predict channel width from the physics of flow, sediment transport and bedrock erosion remains unanswered.

To explore controls on bedrock channel width, I developed mechanitsic models for lateral erosion by impacts of bedload and suspended load, evolved bedrock channel evolution to explore the width dynamics, and used field observations in Fraser Canyon, British Columbia to investigate the local variations in cross-sectional morphology and flow dynamics.
