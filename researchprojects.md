## What Controls Bedrock Channel Width?
Despite over 100 years of research on bedrock rivers, predicting channel width relies on empirical relations between water discharge and width or theory that makes bizarre assumptions about energy or roughness optimization with no physics basis. The question of how to predict channel width from the physics of flow, sediment transport and bedrock erosion remains unanswered.

To explore controls on bedrock channel width, I develop mechanitsic models for lateral erosion by impacts of bedload and suspended load, simulate bedrock channel evolution to explore the width dynamics, and use field observations in Fraser Canyon, British Columbia to investigate the local variations in cross-sectional morphology and flow dynamics.

## How Sediment Control Landscape Evolution?
Grain size links topography to climate, tectonics, and lithology by governing the rates of river incision into bedrock. However, landscape evolution models commonly rely on the stream power model that assumes bedrock incision rates scale with the unit stream power or shear stress, without explicitly accounting for the role of grain size due to a lack of understanding of the variations in grain size with climate, tectonics, and lithology. 

I couple a landscape evolution model with a weathering model to explore the controls on grain size at the landscape scale. I further couple the weathering model with mechanistic models for incision into bedrock to explore the feedbacks between grain size and topography.
